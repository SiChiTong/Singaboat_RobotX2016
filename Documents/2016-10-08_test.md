### 2016-09-19 ~~ 2016-09-23 ###
1. yellow computer repartition and install **finished**
2. usb devices [udev rules](http://askubuntu.com/questions/670197/udev-rules-targeting-every-usb-device)
or follow [linorobot](https://linorobot.org/getting-started/)
3. integrate GPS with `nmea_navsat_driver` and `navsat_transform`, publish `/navsat/fix` as `sensor_msgs/NavSatFix` and `navsat/vel`
4. integrate IMU with customized code (suggest to buy newer version so that we can use `razor-imu-9dof`)
5. `cmd_vel` must be written and can control the motors

### 2016-09-24 ~~ 2016-09-30 ###
1. opencv on color detection and object detection, use `cv2.Canny` for edge detection and `cv2.threshold` on HSV color detection
2. train cascade classifiers for circle, triangle and cross and apply cascade classifier
3. calibrate camera with checkboard
4. dry run and prepare for water test

Water Test
----------
### 2016-10-08 ###
Objectives:

0. setup the ROSMASTER and BaseStation and sync time
1. map the speed command from `cmd_vel` to the actual boat speed
2. see the actual performance of `IMU` and `GPS`
3. see the actual performance of cameras
4. test the safety control and emergency stop
5. test the system integrity

#### thing to do before touch into water ####
0. udev rule for all the sensors
1. all connections are correct
2. laptop and onboat computers are connected in an intranet
3. can listen to `cmd_vel` and the motor can run
4. GPS and IMU and camera can run
5. enough space for data storage
6. installed `opencv`, `openssh`, `ntpdate`

#### setup computer networks ####
refer to **ROS by Example** 4.12
1. for the onboat computer (master), put:
```bash
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://<masterip>:11311
export ROS_IP=<masterip>
```
in `~/.bashrc`

for the shore computer (observer), put:
```bash
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://<masterip>:11311
export ROS_IP=<observerip>
```
in `~/.bashrc`

2. from observer, login to the master by:
```bash
ssh -Y <username>@<masterip>
# in master
roscore
```

3. sync time by:
```bash
# on the observer
sudo ntpdate -b <masterip>
```
anytime you find the command has time problem (mostly in movebase), run this command.

#### command and speed mapping ####
refer to **ROS by Example** 7.4 
1. bringup the base controller so that you can use keyboard to send the `cmd_vel`,
alternatively, use:
```bash
roslaunch robotx_bringup wamv_minimal.launch
# test linear movement
rostopic pub /cmd_vel -r 10 geometry_msgs/Twist '{linear: {x: 1, y: 0, z: 0}, {angular: {x: 0, y: 0, z: 0}}'
# test angular movement
rostopic pub /cmd_vel -r 10 geometry_msgs/Twist '{linear: {x: 0, y: 0, z: 0}, {angular: {x: 0, y: 0, z: 1}}'
# stop
rostopic pub /cmd_vel -r 10 geometry_msgs/Twist '{}'
```
else, use the `calibrate_linear.py` and `calibrate_angular.py` to calibrate (refer to 7.4)
```bash
roslaunch robotx_bringup wamv_minimal.launch
roslaunch robotx_control wamv_control.launch #TODO
rosrun robotx_nav calibrate_linear.py
rosrun robotx_nav calibrate_angular.py
```

#### IMU and GPS ####
1. launch IMU and GPS
2. move the boat linear and back for several times
3. during the movement, save the data by `rosbag`
4. analyze the IMU and GPS data by `rqt_plot` or `matplotlib` in python
5. see the `linear x`, `angular z` in `imu/data` and `xyz` in `navsat/vel`
```bash
roslaunch robotx_bringup wamv_minimal.launch
roslaunch robotx_sensor gps_serial.launch
roslaunch robotx_sensor imu_razor.launch
roslaunch robotx_sensor navsat_vel_odom.launch
```

#### camera ####
1. make sure the cameras are calibrated
2. the naming convention is : `bow/left` `bow/right` for the from two cameras,
`port/left` `port/right` for the left two cameras and `starboard/left` `starboard/right`
for the right two cameras.
3. make sure the cameras can output `image/raw` `image/rect` and `camera_info`
4. do not use `rosbag` to record video, it will occupy too much space, instead, 
use opencv to (capture and write)[https://pythonprogramming.net/loading-video-python-opencv-tutorial/]
but make sure you update the opencv to 2.4.13.1 (2.4.9 is still OK for this test)
